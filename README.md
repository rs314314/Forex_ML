# Forex_ML

This project is about using Data Science and Analytics as well as Machine Learning models to develop a consistent way to maximize return on risk in the Foreign Exchange market (Forex). I had initial guidance from this youtube channel/playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbecO6a-zAI6cuGP1LLnmW8e) in developing the skeletal structure and initial coding exploration of this project.

Some of the TOOLS AND SKILLS that I utilize in this project are custom Python modules, data collection using API calls, data exploration and visualization using MatPlotLib, the Pandas module, the numpy module, and SciKit-Learn. Using many Jupyter Notebooks and Python script files. I created files and functions that collected data from Oanda and translate it from JSON into a Pandas data frame. From there I created market price indicators to add to the data and then used all of this to create two models for one Forex pair. Gathering the final results for this project was a lot of fun (resulting ROR is located in Test_fx3.ipynb) and I enjoyed learning and developing my Python and Data Science skills along the way!
